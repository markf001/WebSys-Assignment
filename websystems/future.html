      <h3>In the future, my goal is to become an expert in software development, specialising in machine learning 
        and artificial intelligence. Using the experience I gain in the industry, I would then like to contribute in establishing projects
      that create and have a long-lasting impact on society.</h3>

      <h3>My other goal for the future is to play competitively in volleyball, at a level that I could never imagine when
        I started. Although it isn't related to my career nor is it a main goal in my life, it is something I would like to
        achieve as it has always been a dream of mine to play a sport at a high level.</h3>
